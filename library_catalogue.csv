1,1 & 2 Thessalonians (Reformed Expository Commentary),Richard D. Phillips,Commentaries,9781596389779,159638977X,"Years before writing Romans or Ephesians, Paul sent a pair of letters to a new church in Thessalonica. Three concerns governed Paul's teaching in these letters: What makes a healthy church? How should we view God's Word? What does a Christian life look like? Richard D. Phillips's commentary considers these foundational issues in a scholarly, pastoral, and practical manner and also explores Paul's end-times teaching‚Äîthe clearest found in the New Testament. Through these studies, readers will find a refreshingly clear biblical summary of what will happen before, during, and after the Second Coming. Just as importantly, by touring Paul's singular teaching in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, readers will recover a joyful anticipation of Christ's return and receive hope for life in a challenging world.",P &amp; R Publishing,2015-11-13,2023-05-20,480
2,1 Kings (Reformed Expository Commentary),Philip Graham Ryken,Commentaries,9781596382084,1596382082,"Dynasties, fractured kingdoms, prophecies of coming hardships -- the book of 1 Kings is a grand, sweeping narrative of the beginning of the downfall of God&#039;s people. Its size and scope may seem intimidating, but Phil Ryken shows us in this biblical, doctrinal, practical, and Christological commentary how this imposing book can be divided into three key sections. First, the stories of Solomon focus on the themes of money, sex, and power, inviting us to learn from Solomon&#039;s example. Will we use these things wisely for kingdom purposes or foolishly abuse them for selfish gain? Then the middle of the story, on the divided kingdom, shows the destructive consequences of sin among the people of God -- especially the sin of idolatry. The final section demonstrates the power of prayer to the true and living God, as exemplified in the life and ministry of God&#039;s prophet Elijah.Phil Ryken brings out the key themes of these three sections and illustrates how they come together in their focus on the gospel of Jesus Christ, especially his kingly and prophetic offices. This is an excellent resource for those who want a devotional aid and will help Bible expositors reliably teach a redemptive-historical view of this important Old Testament book.",P & R Publishing,2011-05-09,2023-05-20,636

4,1 Samuel (Reformed Expository Commentary),Richard D. Phillips,Commentaries,9781596381971,1596381973,"David is more than a great hero, a man of faith, and a model for Christians to follow. He is one of the most important Old Testament types of Jesus Christ. It is as an anointed one--called and provided by God to lead Israel--that David plays his chief role in redemptive history and makes his distinctive contribution in preparing God&#039;s people for the Anointed One, the Messiah who comes to rule and to save.Two other significant figures--Samuel and Saul--appear in 1 Samuel. Samuel, an epochal figure whose significance equals that of Joshua, guides Israel out of the chaotic period of the judges and serves the coming of the Davidic kingdom. Saul, an alter ego first to Samuel and then to David, personifies the idolatry and unbelief that plague Israel throughout the Old Testament. The ways in which he contrasts with Samuel and David provide valuable spiritual lessons. The lesser characters in 1 Samuel are hardly incidental: Eli the corrupted priest, Hannah the tearful believer, and Jonathan the faithful friend, to name just three.As are all the books in the Reformed Expository Commentary series, this exposition of 1 Samuel is accessible to both pastors and lay readers. Each volume in the series provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.",P & R Publishing,2012-05-20,2023-05-20,576
5,1 Timothy (Reformed Expository Commentary),Philip Graham Ryken,Commentaries,9781596380493,1596380497,"From worship and prayer to family and the use of money, the book of 1 Timothy is full of implications for life in the local church. But beyond these practical truths for all believers, Ryken writes, &quot;Paul&#039;s purpose in 1 Timothy is to help his spiritual son remain true.&quot; Thus the book has special application to those in gospel ministry. These truths that helped Timothy in his day are just as applicable to church leaders in ours -- both for personal godliness and for the collective life of the church. Whether for personal study or sermon preparation, Ryken&#039;s exposition is a sure guide to all who are interested in this pastoral epistle. As are all of the books in the Reformed Expository Commentary series, this exposition of 1 Timothy is accessible to both pastors and lay readers. Each volume in the series provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.",P & R Publishing,2007-06-01,2023-05-20,312

Secondly, we are to obey God's commandments. Thirdly, we must love others.In this illuminating and engaging commentary on John's letters, pastor-scholar Douglas Sean O'Donnell illustrates and applies these three essential tests that judge whether we possess eternal life or not.

Although the book's overarching narrative is one of tragic decline leading to exile, hope remains as God again and again fulfills his promise to never to let go of the line of David. In this Reformed Expository Commentary, Philip Graham Ryken traces the overarching narrative of 2 Kings, connects it to Christ, and explores its applications for ordinary Christians in today's world. This historical book has everyday relevance as it shows God's concern for people in serious need as well as the near- and long-term consequences of idolatry.

19,A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life,"Joel R. Beeke, Mark Jones",Systematic Theology,9781601781666,1601781660,"A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life offers a groundbreaking treatment of the Puritans teaching on most major Reformed doctrines, particularly those doctrines in which the Puritans made significant contributions. Since the late 1950s, nearly 150 Puritan authors and 700 Puritan titles have been reprinted and catalogued by Joel Beeke and Randall Pederson in their 2006 collection of mini-biographies and book reviews, titled, Meet the Puritans. However, no work until now has gathered together the threads of their teaching into a unified tapestry of systematic theology.  A Puritan Theology, by Joel Beeke and Mark Jones, attempts to do that. The book addresses Puritan teachings on all six loci of theology, covering fifty areas of doctrine. The book explores Puritan teachings on biblical interpretation, God, predestination, providence, angels, sin, the covenants, the gospel, Christ, preparation for conversion, regeneration, coming to Christ, justification, adoption, church government, the Sabbath, preaching, baptism, heaven, hell, and many other topics. It ends with eight chapters that explore Puritan theology in practice. Some chapters highlight the work of a specific theologian such as William Perkins, William Ames, John Owen, Stephen Charnock, or Thomas Goodwin on a specific topic. Other chapters survey various authors on a particular subject. The goal of A Puritan Theology is to increase knowledge in the mind and godliness in the soul.

As a result, Christianity's influence in nineteenth-century England was severely weakened. One hundred years later, John MacArthur, troubled by the seeker-sensitive movement and an emphasis on pragmatism within the church, sounded the same alarm with the first edition of Ashamed of the Gospel.In this newly revised and expanded edition, MacArthur gives an overview of developments in the seeker-sensitive movement since his book was first published in 1993. New material traces the line of pragmatic philosophy from the seeker-sensitive movement through the Emergent phenomenon, explaining why the latter is a philosophical heir of the former-and an even greater danger; chronicles the failure of pragmatic approaches to church growth; and emphasizes the importance of evangelicals solidly committed to biblical doctrine rising to positions of leadership.",Crossway,2018-12-31,2023-06-17,304

According to Page Kelley, his book is &quot;designed not so much for seasoned travelers as for those who are just starting out on a strange and wonderful journey.&quot;The book consists of thirty-one lessons arranged as follows: the nonverbal aspects of the language (lessons 1-10); the verb forms and their functions, with special attention to the strong verbs (lessons 11-20); the coordinate relationship of verbs, a topic alluded to but seldom developed in other grammars (lesson 21); and a comprehensive introduction to each of the ten classes of weak verbs (lessons 22-31). The grammar is accompanied by eleven complete verb charts, an extensive vocabulary list, a glossary of grammatical terms, and a subject index.Kelley employs a method that one reviewer has described as a cross between a straight presentation of grammatical principles and rules and a semi-inductive presentation of concepts through the exercises. Each lesson first presents new grammatical concepts, with biblical examples, and then provides reinforcing exercises that Kelley has judiciously selected from the biblical text (the exercises do not presuppose vocabulary and grammar not already covered).Deriving from the author&#039;s forty years of experience in teaching Biblical Hebrew to seminary students, and enthusiastically employed in its developing stages by instructors at a variety of colleges and seminaries, Kelley&#039;s Biblical Hebrew: An Introductory Grammar promises to be an excellent teaching tool with high potential as a textbook.

Sommer",Biblical Theology,9780687341009,0687341000,"One of the thorniest problems in theological study is the relationship between biblical studies on the one hand, and constructive theology on the other. Theologians know that the Bible is the core source document for theological construction, and hence that they must be in conversation with the best in critical study of Scripture. For many biblical scholars, the point of¬†what they do is to help the biblical text speak to today‚Äôs church and world, and hence they would do well to be in conversation with contemporary theology. Yet too often the two groups fail to¬† engage each other‚Äôs work in significant and productive ways. The purpose of the Library of Biblical Theology, and this introductory volume to it, is to bring the worlds of biblical scholarship and constructive theology together. It will do so by reviving biblical theology as a discipline that describes the faith of the biblical periods on the one hand, and on the other hand articulates normative understandings of modern faith and practice.¬† In this volume the authors begin by providing an overview of the history and possible future of biblical theology. They introduce biblical theology as a fundamentally contrastive discipline, one that is neither dogmatic theology (seeking to explain the official teachings of a particular Christian tradition), nor is it a purely historical approach to Scripture, eschewing questions of the Bible‚Äôs contemporary message and meaning. Rather, biblical theology takes seriously both the need to understand the message of Scripture in its particular historical context, and the need to address that message to questions that confront contemporary human life.",Abingdon Press,2009-05-01,2023-05-20,337

How do we communicate the concepts of grace and substitutionary atonement in our globalized culture and context?

This book outlines a theological vision for ministry - applying classic doctrines to our time and place - organized around three core commitments: * Gospel-centered: The gospel of grace in Jesus Christ changes everything, from our hearts to our community to the world. It completely reshapes the content, tone and strategy of all that we do. * City-centered: With a positive approach toward our culture, we learn to affirm that cities are wonderful, strategic and underserved places for gospel ministry. * Movement-centered: Instead of building our own tribe, we seek the prosperity and peace of our community as we are led by the Holy Spirit. &#039;In this important book, Tim Keller unpacks the gospel and gently but firmly reminds us that it is nonnegotiable. At the same time, he enables us to think through how we can responsibly interact with the culture, how we can - indeed, must - appreciate good things within it, and how we can firmly and faithfully apply the gospel to it.&#039; - D.A.

In Christ Alone, Stephen Wellum considers Christ's singular uniqueness and significance biblically, historically, and today, in our pluralistic and postmodern age. He examines the historical roots of the doctrine, especially in the Reformation era, and then shows how the uniqueness of Christ has come under specific attack today. Then, he walks us through the storyline of Scripture, from Christ's unique identity and work as prophet, priest, and king, to the application of his work to believers and our covenantal union with him to show that apart from Christ there is no salvation. Wellum shows that we must recover a robust biblical and theological doctrine of Christ's person and work in the face of today's challenges and explains why a fresh appraisal of the Reformation understanding of Christ alone is needed today.",Zondervan,2017-04-18,2023-06-17,352

Addressing, from an exposition of Romans 8:34, the pastoral problem that many believers stray in their faith by looking into their own hearts for signs of grace instead of looking away from themselves to Christ, Christ Set Forth is primarily a book written to encourage Christians. As Scott Berggren says in the Foreword, It is a guidebook for keeping one's heart and faith pointed in the right direction, towards Christ himself. In it Goodwin pushes aside anything that might displace Christ in one's heart. In chapter after chapter he sets forth the glory of Christ and his work as mediator as the only object of one s faith and affection.",Banner of Truth,2015-03-06,2023-05-20,264

We turn to them in good days and bad, to both praise God with thanksgiving and to plead with God for help. The struggles of David and the other psalmists resonate with us and we treasure the same promises of the LORD that they relied on. The meditations in Christ's Psalms, Our Psalms - Devotional uncover those treasures. Sixteen Reformed pastors write rich yet easy-to-understand devotions that will help strengthen your faith in God. Even more, the Devotional shows how Jesus Christ is foreshadowed in all the laments, praises, thanksgivings and words of wisdom found throughout the Psalms. Like David and the other poets, Jesus suffered greatly, learned to lean on His Father intensely, and had cause to give thanks abundantly - and all this He went through as our Mediator. Each devotion helps us to know our Saviour more deeply. Three appendices add psalm devotions for those special dates on the Christian calendar: Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, Resurrection, Ascension and Pentecost.

For this collection of churches in a culture antagonistic to the gospel, the apostle Paul pens themes so grand they can still take our breath away, and they often move the apostle to doxology and prayer.Bryan Chapell, noted preacher and teacher of preaching, unfolds Paul&#039;s glorious description of how the triumph of the church will occur and what our roles are in Christ&#039;s ultimate victory. When we lift our eyes beyond personal borders to share even a glimpse of Paul&#039;s expansive vision, then we, too, will join his doxology for God&#039;s amazing grace that saves individuals, empowers the church, and through both, transforms the world.This exposition of Ephesians is accessible to both pastors and lay readers, as are all titles in the Reformed Expository Commentary series. Each provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.",P & R Publishing,2009-08-05,2023-05-20,383

123,Esther and Ruth (Reformed Expository Commentary),Iain M. Duguid,Commentaries,9780875527833,0875527833,"Does God help those who help themselves? That may seem to be the message of the Books of Esther and Ruth. Some think that Ruth&#039;s attractiveness won over Naomi and Boaz, or that Esther&#039;s bold faithfulness saved her people. But a closer reading shows an embittered Naomi to have abandoned the Promised Land and God&#039;s people, and Esther to have become thoroughly assimilated to the culture and values of Persian society. In Esther, God works in invisible ways to save his people. In Ruth, God&#039;s grace comes to Naomi unexpectedly, and with it, a depiction of redemption for her people. In both books, a gracious and sovereign God works through flawed individuals--unable even to help themselves--to rescue his people and prepare for the coming of Christ. As part of the Reformed Expository Commentary series, Esther and Ruth is aimed at both pastors and lay readers. Each volume in the series provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.",P & R Publishing,2005-10-01,2023-05-20,201

A Puritan and Calvinistic Baptist heritage served to mould Spurgeon's life and the development of his ministry. The pivotal influence of the writings of John Bunyan, John Gill and Andrew Fuller are examined in detail. Spurgeon's faithful and intimate walk with God undergirded his preaching, teaching and writing ministries and provided the impetus that led him to establish many organizations and societies to relieve poverty, assist people with addictions and provide homes for orphans. C.H. Spurgeon was the preeminent Baptist evangelist/preacher in nineteenth-century England. His sermons crossed the Atlantic and were printed and distributed each week for many years. Today, the advice he gave to ministry students, his extensive sermon collection and his written works continue to teach.",Carey Printing Press,2011-08-01,2023-06-17,192

In their different ways, Ezra and Nehemiah both prioritized the Word of God and the practice of prayer.

174,Faith Alone---The Doctrine of Justification: What the Reformers Taught...and Why It Still Matters (The Five Solas Series),Thomas R. Schreiner,The 5 Solas Series,9780310515784,0310515785,"Historians and theologians have long recognized that at the heart of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation were five declarations, often referred to as the &lsquo;solas&rsquo;: sola scriptura, solus Christus, sola gratia, sola fide, and soli Deo gloria. These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God&rsquo;s glory. In Faith Alone&mdash;The Doctrine of Justification renowned biblical scholar Thomas Schreiner looks at the historical and biblical roots of the doctrine of justification. He summarizes the history of the doctrine, looking at the early church and the writings of several of the Reformers. Then, he turns his attention to the Scriptures and walks readers through an examination of the key texts in the Old and New Testament. He discusses whether justification is transformative or forensic and introduces readers to some of the contemporary challenges to the Reformation teaching of sola fide, with particular attention to the new perspective on Paul. Five hundred years after the Reformation, the doctrine of justification by faith alone still needs to be understood and proclaimed. In Faith Alone you will learn how the rallying cry of &ldquo;sola fide&rdquo; is rooted in the Scriptures and how to apply this sola in a fresh way in light of many contemporary challenges.",Zondervan,2015-09-22,2023-06-17,240

Spurgeon knew, gospel truths fly straighter and truer when fletched with appropriately placed illustrations.

180,For His Holy Name: Judgement and Hope in Ezekiel,"Peter Lau, Eugene Hor",Biblical Theology,9789814597227,9814597228,"Few parts of the Bible address a situation so seemingly without hope as the book of Ezekiel. God's judgement had come upon His people for their disobedience, and they were now suffering in exile in a foreign land. In a world like our own, where so much is uncertain, how can we make sense of a God who certainly sees, judges and punishes sin, yet readily forgives when His people repent? Ezekiel's listeners were people like ourselves; how was his book a direct response to the troubles of his time, and how does he still speak to us thousands of years later?   In this examination of the lessons we can find in the priest-turned-prophet's life and writings, Bible teachers Peter Lau and Eugene Hor show how God's message through Ezekiel can be understood, obeyed and lived in the light of Jesus Christ.",Armour Publishing,2014-06-09,2023-05-20,120

By trying to base their standing with God on their spiritual performance, the Galatians were in danger of denying the gospel. They needed to hear again the liberating message that we are justified not by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. The church today needs to embrace that same gospel message. &quot;We are legalists by nature,&quot; Philip Ryken writes, and Galatians &quot;challenges many of our preconceptions about what it means to have a right relationship with God.&quot; This first commentary in the Reformed Expository Commentary series is for people who want to experience the gospel in all its power, especially teachers and preachers who are looking for a clear, thorough, relevant exposition of Paul&#039;s letter to the Galatians. Ryken exemplifies the objectives of the series by providing exposition that is biblical, doctrinally sound, redemptive-historical (centering on Christ), and practical. &quot;Some commentaries lose the forest for the trees, and others the trees for the forest,&quot; says Mark Dever. &quot;This series promises to be both exegetically sensitive and theologically faithful.&quot;",P & R Publishing,2005-06-03,2023-05-20,290

For the Christian mind seeking to understand the nature of God, a fundamental paradox poses a philosophical stumbling block: how can God be both a wholly independent, infinite being yet also be an interactive force in the finite plane of creation? In God With Us, K. Scott Oliphint finds an answer in the person of Jesus Christ incarnate&mdash;the manifestation of God and the cornerstone of creation.Where other theological efforts view the study of Jesus as simply one aspect of a systematic approach, Oliphint puts a primary focus on understanding the Son of God as both the quintessential revelation of God&rsquo;s character and the explanation of how God relates to us.

These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God‚Äôs glory. In God‚Äôs Glory Alone‚ÄîThe Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life, renowned scholar David VanDrunen looks at the historical and biblical roots of the idea that all glory belongs to God alone. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation, in subsequent Reformed theology and confessions, and in contemporary theologians who continue to be inspired by the conviction that all glory belongs to God. Then he turns to the biblical story of God's glory, beginning with the pillar of cloud and fire revealed to Israel, continuing through the incarnation, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminating in Christ's Second Coming and the glorification of his people. In light of these wonderful biblical themes he concludes by addressing several of today's great cultural challenges and temptations‚Äîsuch as distraction and narcissism‚Äîand reflecting on how commitment to God's glory alone fortifies us to live godly lives in this present evil age.",Zondervan,2015-12-01,2023-06-17,240

Understanding that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him has made all the difference for John Piper-and can transform your life as well.

Readers influenced by this competing worldview hold assumptions about fundamental issues&mdash;like the nature of humanity, evil, and the purpose of life&mdash;that present profound obstacles to understanding the Bible.In Inerrancy and Worldview, Dr. Vern Poythress offers the first worldview-based defense of scriptural inerrancy, showing how worldview differences create or aggravate most perceived difficulties with the Bible. His positive case for biblical inerrancy implicitly critiques the worldview of theologians like Enns, Sparks, Allert, and McGowan. Poythress, who has researched and published in a variety of fields&mdash; including science, linguistics, and sociology&mdash;deals skillfully with the challenges presented in each of these disciplines. By directly addressing key examples in each field, Poythress shows that many difficulties can be resolved simply by exposing the influence of modern materialism.Inerrancy and Worldview&rsquo;s positive response to current attempts to abandon or redefine inerrancy will enable Christians to respond well to modern challenges by employing a worldview that allows the Bible to speak on its own terms.",Crossway,2012-05-02,2023-05-20,272

Re-typeset into a clean and modern typeface, this edition is easy to read for the modern eye. This book will appeal to libraries, seminarians, pastors, and laypeople. Institutes of the Christian Religion by John Calvin is an introduction to the Bible and a vindication of Reformation principles by one of the Reformation's finest scholars. At the age of twenty-six, Calvin published several revisions of his Institutes of the Christian Religion, a seminal work in Christian theology that altered the course of Western history and that is still read by theological students today. It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone. It vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism, to which Calvin says he had been ""strongly devoted"" before his conversion to Protestantism. The over-arching theme of the book--and Calvin's greatest theological legacy--is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in salvation and election.","Hendrickson Publishers, Inc.",2007-12-01,2023-05-20,1059

It offers concrete counsel on trials, poverty and riches, favoritism, social justice, the tongue, worldliness, boasting, planning, prayer, illness, and more. But in doing so, it exposes our inability to measure up to God&#039;s standard.Daniel Doriani, a pastor and scholar recognized for his works on biblical interpretation and application, resolves the tension between the wide-ranging practical commands of James and the centrality of faith in the Christian life. While James may not articulate the doctrine of atonement through the death and resurrection of Jesus, James does present Christ in his own way. Here Doriani shows us how. He thus helps us to apply the wisdom of James in a way that is rooted in grace. As part of the Reformed Expository Commentary series, this commentary is written for both pastors and lay teachers. Each volume in the series provides exposition that gives careful attention to the biblical text, is doctrinally Reformed, focuses on Christ through the lens of redemptive history, and applies the Bible to our contemporary setting.",P & R Publishing,2007-03-01,2023-05-20,220

Spurgeon, &#039;the book that I value most is John Bunyan&#039;s Pilgrim&#039;s Progress ... it is a book of which I never seem to tire, but then the secret of that is, that John Bunyan&#039;s Pilgrim&#039;s Progress is the Bible in another shape. It is the same heavenly water taken out of this same well of the gospel.&#039; Dr J. Gresham Machen described it as &#039;that tenderest and most theological of books ... that is pulsating with life in every word&#039;. Yet today many dismiss The Pilgrim&#039;s Progress as a book for children and young people. Others study it from the perspective of literary style or historical interest, but neglect, or even reject the central message of biblical truth which lies at the very heart of the work and which was fundamental to Bunyan&#039;s purpose in writing. In this volume Barry Horner highlights the major themes running through the allegory and discusses important issues concerning its relevance and how best to make it known in the twenty-first century. He shows how, rightly understood and suitably presented, The Pilgrim&#039;s Progress has a vital message for today&#039;s generation and is a most valuable tool both for evangelism and for encouraging the spiritual growth of believers. Dr Barry E. Horner is pastor of Christian Fellowship Church in North Brunswick in the USA and has spent many years studying the life, ministry and literature of John Bunyan. As the host of a series of popular teaching seminars on The Pilgrim&#039;s Progress, and the author of a revision of the text of the allegory, he has been instrumental in bringing Bunyan&#039;s classic alive for a new generation of readers across the English-speaking world.",Evangelical Press,2003-05-30,2023-06-17,516

Moreover, Jonah reminds us that the chief characteristic of redeemed people is not that they never sin, for sadly we still do, but that they are ready to repent of their sin when reminded of God&#039;s grace.The prophet Micah lived several generations later than Jonah. Whereas God called Jonah to cry out to the wicked idolaters in Nineveh, he called Micah to cry out against the wicked sinners of Jerusalem. Unlike the earlier prophet, who wrestled against God&#039;s gospel message for pagan unbelievers, Micah was brokenhearted in his fervent desire for Jerusalem to repent and believe.A study of Jonah will connect us with our mission to the world.

He knew that the outward acts of sin spring from the inner desires of the heart. Merely to alter a person‚Äôs behavior without dealing with those desires would cultivate hypocrisy, the self-righteous cloak for a cold and vicious heart. Sibbes believed that hearts must be turned, and evil desires eclipsed by stronger ones for Christ. Josiah‚Äôs Reformation is as relevant today as when it was first published in 1629. Our busyness and activism so easily degenerate into a hypocrisy in which we keep up all the appearance of holiness without the heart of it. Christians even use Christ as a package to pass on to others, instead of enjoying him first and foremost as their own Savior. But true reformation must begin in the heart, with love for Christ.

Bounds stresses the imperative of vital prayer in the life of a pastor. He says, "". . . every preacher who does not make prayer a mighty factor in his own life and ministry is weak as a factor in God's work and is powerless to project God's cause in this world."" Recreation to a minister must be as whetting is with the mower--that is, to be used only so far as is necessary for his work. May a physician in plague-time take any more relaxation or recreation than is necessary for his life, when so many are expecting his help in a case of life and death? Will you stand by and see sinners gasping under the pangs of death, and say: ""God doth not require me to make myself a drudge to save them?"" Is this the voice of ministerial or Christian compassion or rather of sensual laziness and diabolical cruelty.--Richard Baxter

At the centre of Israel's worship was the tabernacle. At the centre of the tabernacle was a box: the Ark of the Covenant. Within the box was a covenant.

Covenant dominates the Bible's story from start to finish, shaping the gospel, the church and the day-to-day experience of God's people.

But for many of us, covenant is a lost concept. Raiding the Lost Ark seeks to recover the great news of Jesus Christ as Covenant King, demonstrating the natural flow from the story God tells to the gospel of grace.

Christians learn to worship from the generations of God's people who have worshipped before them. We sing Psalms, because thousands of years ago, God's people sang them. 500 years ago, the leaders of the Reformation transformed Christian worship with the active participation and understanding of the individual worshiper. Christian worship today is built on this foundation. Jonathan Gibson and Mark Earngey have made Reformation worship accessible, by compiling the most comprehensive collection of liturgies from that era, newly translated into modern English from the original German, Dutch, French, Latin, and early English. The structure of the liturgies, language, and rhythm continue to communicate the gospel in Word and Sacrament today. They provide a deep sense of God‚Äôs call to worship and an appreciation for the Reformers as, first and foremost, men who wanted to help God‚Äôs people worship. This book will also be of great interest to theological scholars and students who wish to understand early Reformation leaders. A useful tool for individuals, Reformation Worship, can be used as a powerful devotional to guide daily prayer and reflection. By providing a connection to the great men of the Reformation, Gibson and Earngey hope that through their work readers will experience what John Calvin described to be the purpose of all church worship: To what end is the preaching of the Word, the Sacraments, the holy congregations themselves, and indeed the whole external government of the church, except that we may be united to God?",New Growth Press,2018-04-23,2023-06-17,736

Christians are not on a mission for God; his church is on his mission the mission of bringing the grace of Christ to sinners; the mission of bringing the whole world into obedience to Christ; and the mission of covering the earth with the knowledge of the glory of God in Christ Jesus. Being on God s mission means following Jesus into the darkest places of the world to bring the good news of the total redeeming work of Christ. Leading reformed thinkers including Tim Keller, Thomas Schirrmacher, P. J.

Jerry Bridges returns to his trademark theme of holiness and addresses a dozen clusters of specific &quot;acceptable&quot; sins that we tend to tolerate in ourselves - such as jealousy, anger, pride, unthankfulness, and judgmentalism.  Jerry writes not from a height of spiritual accomplishment but from the trenches of his own battles with sin.

For many, Calvinism evokes the idea of a harsh God who saves a select few and condemns others to eternal torment. Others find comfort in the Five Points of TULIP with its emphasis on the sovereignty of God's grace.   Oliver Crisp thinks both sides have too small a picture of the Reformed tradition. There are ample resources for developing a more expansive Calvinism. Reformed Christians have inherited a vast mansion, but many of them only live in two rooms, reading John Calvin and Jonathan Edwards on repeat, while the rest of the house lies waiting for someone to discover its treasures.  Saving Calvinism explores some of the thorniest problems in the Reformed tradition, including free will, the extent of the atonement, and the possibility of universal salvation. By engaging a host of Reformed thinkers and exploring often ignored ideas, Crisp shows that Calvinism is much more diverse and flexible than the stereotype suggests.",IVP Academic,2016-12-04,2023-06-17,167

Their watchword was: I preach as never sure to preach again,And as a dying man to dying men.

How did the Israelites respond to it?The dead apparently went to Sheol. Where and what was it?The inhabitants of Sheol are sometimes called &quot;shades.&quot; What does this indicate?Many ancient peoples venerated their ancestors. Did Israelites do this?Did anyone hope for a positive afterlife? If so, in what form?What about resurrection? How and when did this belief emerge? Philip S. Johnston explores these and other issues. He examines Israelite views on death and afterlife as reflected in the Hebrew Bible and in material remains, and sets them in their cultural, literary and theological contexts. Johnston argues in detail that the Israelites were not as preoccupied with the underworld or the dead as some scholars have recently alleged. Instead, their faith that Yahweh was the God of the living, and that Sheol was cut off from him, led eventually to the hope of a positive afterlife. This important study sheds fresh light on Israelite beliefs in an area central to the later development of the Christian faith.",Apollos,2002-01-01,2023-06-17,288

So wrote C.H. Spurgeon in his Preface to this book. He counted Thomas Brooks among his favourite Puritan authors, and it is not hard to see why. Brooks&#039; popularity lies both in his subjects - practical truths, central to the Christian life - and in the manner of his presentation. He is ever direct, urgent, fervent, full of Scripture, and able to choose words which make his sentences stick in one&#039;s mind.This book is a collection of sentences, illustrations, and quaint sayings from this renowned Puritan. Gathered by Spurgeon out of the 6 volume set of Brooks&#039; Works, it remains an excellent introduction to both the man and his writings.Spurgeon continues, Reader, thou hast here presented to thee, in a cheap and readable form, the choice sayings of one of the King&#039;s mighties. The great divine who wrote these precious sentences was of the race of the giants. He was head and shoulders above all the people, not in his stature (like Saul), but in mind, and soul, and grace. Treasure these gems, and adorn thyself with them, by putting them into the golden setting of holy practice, which is the end the writer always aimed at. Use these &#039;smooth stones&#039; as David of old, and may the Lord direct them to the very forehead of thy sins, for this is the author&#039;s main design! One of these pithy extracts may assist our meditations for a whole day, and may open up some sweet passage of Scripture to our understandings, and perhaps some brief sentence may stick in the sinner&#039;s conscience, like an arrow from the bow of God.

In many ways, it reflects the biblical vision of what every minister is called to be: pastor, teacher, counsellor, and example - but also a man who is growing spiritually, both in understanding and in character, before the eyes of his congregation.In five sections and thirty-nine chapters, Sinclair B Ferguson writes on pastor-teachers whose life and work have left an indelible mark on his own life, and then leads us in a series of chapters on the teaching of John Calvin, John Owen and the seventeenth century Puritans. This is followed by studies of Scripture, the ministry of the Spirit, the nature of Biblical Theology, the work of Christ, adoption, the nature of the Christian life and other important doctrines. The final section discusses various aspects of preaching, including preaching Christ from the Old Testament, the importance of theology, reaching the heart, and concludes with a decalogue for preachers. All this, as the epilogue makes clear, is set within the context and goal of doxology.Here is a book to return to again and again, for instruction, for challenge, and also for enjoyment. While written particularly with ministers in view its style makes it accessible to all. Dr Ferguson describes Some Pastors and Teachers as a series of small gifts for fellow-ministers and others, written as an expression of the love of Christ. It is calculated to help both ministers of the gospel and entire congregations to realize Paul's vision of churches growing up into Christ as they are nourished and taught by their pastors and teachers.",Banner of Truth,2017-12-18,2023-06-17,824

And if we're not married or dating, should we be reading this book at all?As a part of Scripture, Song of Songs is God-breathed and useful to instruct all Christians, single or married, divorced or widowed, straight or struggling with same-sex desires.

The deeper tragedy is that in many places the church has become a valley of dry bones. Something is needed to waken the dead and to breathe new life into the people of God. William Perkins (1558-1602) provides basic guidance to help all Christians to read and use the Bible intelligently.

The sentiments of the main speaker of the book, a person given the name Qohelet, sound incredibly modern. Expressing the uncertainty and anxieties of our own age, he is driven by the question, &quot;Where can we find meaning in the world?&quot; But while Qohelet&#039;s question resonates with readers today, his answer is shocking. &quot;Meaningless,&quot; says Qohelet, &quot;everything is meaningless.&quot; How does this pessimistic perspective fit into the rest of biblical revelation? In this commentary Tremper Longman III addresses this question by taking a canonical-Christocentric approach to the meaning of Ecclesiastes. Longman first provides an extensive introduction to Ecclesiastes, exploring such background matters as authorship, language, genre, structure, literary style, and the book&#039;s theological message. He argues that the author of Ecclesiastes is not Solomon, as has been traditionally thought, but a writer who adopts a Solomonic persona. In the verse-by-verse commentary that follows, Longman helps clarify the confusing, sometimes contradictory message of Ecclesiastes by showing that the book should be divided into three sections -- a prologue (1:1-11), Qohelet&#039;s autobiographical speech (1:12-12:7), and an epilogue (12:8-14) -- and that the frame narrative provided by prologue and epilogue is the key to understanding the message of the book as a whole.",Wm.

351,The Christian in Complete Armour,William Gurnall,Puritan Works,9781598564679,1598564676,"At a time in England when loyalty to Scripture placed Christians in the center of the nation&#039;s wars, Gurnall was more concerned with the souls of his people than the issues of conflicting political parties. Compiled from his many sermons on &quot;the saints&#039; war against the devil,&quot; his exhaustive exposition of Ephesians 6:10-20 treats the spiritual battles of believers and their God-given protection.Originally written in three volumes (1655-1662), the book first covers the Christian&#039;s call to arms and describes the nature of the battle and the character of our enemy. The various pieces of godly armor and weapons, and their use on offense and defense, are then described at length, item by item and verse by verse. More pastoral and practical than theological, Gurnall&#039;s work is filled with spiritual insight, encouraging exhortation, and inspiring word pictures concerning the importance of doctrinal truth as &quot;a girdle for the mind,&quot; the power of holiness, the &quot;pre-eminence of faith against other graces,&quot; and much more.Profoundly biblical and as relevant today as it was almost 350 years ago, Gurnall&#039;s work is a resource that will add grace to the library of Calvinist and Arminian alike. This edition includes an introduction and biography of Gurnall by J.C. Ryle.",Hendrickson Pub,2010-03-30,2023-06-17,656

What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between &quot;cheap grace&quot; and &quot;costly grace.&quot; &quot;Cheap grace,&quot; Bonhoeffer wrote, &quot;is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life.&quot; The Cost of Discipleship is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.",Touchstone,1995-09-01,2023-06-17,320

In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?&quot; With compelling honesty John Stott confronts this generation with the centrality of the cross in God&#039;s redemption of the world -- a world now haunted by the memories of Auschwitz, the pain of oppression and the specter of nuclear war.Can we see triumph in tragedy, victory in shame? Why should an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith? And what does it mean for us today?Now from one of the foremost preachers and Christian leaders of our day comes theology at its readable best, a contemporary restatement of the meaning of the cross. At the cross Stott finds the majesty and love of God disclosed, the sin and bondage of the world exposed.More than a study of the atonement, this book brings Scripture into living dialog with Christian theology and the twentieth century. What emerges is a pattern for Christian life and worship, hope and mission.Destined to be a classic study of the center of our faith, Stott&#039;s work is the product of a uniquely gifted pastor, scholar and Christian statesman.

He never lost sight of the fact that the best Christian counselling is done by the Holy Spirit through the patient and lively exposition of God's word. Sibbes excelled as a comforter of the troubled and doubting. But he also possessed a rare gift of illuminating every passage of Scripture he handled by drawing out its significance for his hearers and readers. These features of Sibbes's ministry figure prominently in The Glorious Feast of the Gospel. Sibbes takes for his text Isaiah 26:6-9 in order to display 'Christ's gracious invitation and royal entertainment of believers.' The subject-matter is a perfect blend of rich doctrine and practical application. Here is an 'admirable feast indeed ... Jesus Christ is the master of the feast, and the cheer and provision too.'

The world, they say, would be a better place without it.&nbsp;  Historian and Christian apologist Larry Taunton has spent much of his career refuting just this sort of thinking, but when he encounters Sasha, a golden-haired Ukranian orphan girl whose life has been shaped by atheistic theorists, he discovers an unlikely champion for the transforming power of grace.&nbsp;  Through the narrative of Sasha&rsquo;s redemption, we see the false promises of socialism; the soul-destroying influence of unbelief; and how a society cultivates its own demise when it rejects the ultimate source of grace.&nbsp; We see, in short, the kind of world the atheists would give us: a world without Christianity&mdash;cold, pitiless, and graceless. And yet, as Sasha shows us, it is a world that is not beyond the healing power of &ldquo;the grace effect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Occasionally infuriating, often amusing, but always inspiring, The Grace Effect will have you cheering for the courageous little girl who shamed the academic elitists of our day.Endorsements:&quot;In&nbsp;The Grace Effect --&nbsp;Larry Taunton&#039;s deeply moving and personal story of how his family adopted a Ukranian girl -- we behold the staggering contrast between a culture suffused with Christian faith and one that has utterly rejected it. &nbsp;Atheists must assiduously avoid exposure to stories like this one. &nbsp;If you&#039;ve ever been unsure of how much good Christianity does in the world, read this book.&quot; &mdash;Eric Metaxas,&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Best-selling author of&nbsp;Bonhoeffer: &nbsp;Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy. &quot;This highly readable book is a collection of powerful insights into the long-term consequences of spiritual indifference and, above all, a remarkable example of how to conquer it.&quot; &mdash; Dr. Olivera Petrovich, research psychologist, University of Oxford &quot;What would a world without Christianity look like?&nbsp;We don&#039;t have to guess because such a world&nbsp;does&nbsp;exist: it exists in the current and former Communist bloc.

Sadly, Western seminaries and missions agencies have done great damage to the global church by exporting widespread doubt in the veracity of God's Word.    This collection of essays, written by faculty and graduates from each of The Master's Academy International's training centers around the world, illustrates the global implications of biblical inerrancy and highlights the devastating consequences of its abandonment.      The Master's Academy International (TMAI) is a network of training centers around the globe that trains pastors and church leaders to faithfully exposit God's Word and shepherd Christ's flock. Here is what others have said about TMAI:   TMAI trains godly men right where they are. That means more men to rightly divide the Word, more men to faithfully shepherd God's flock, and more men to plant and build churches all over the world.  Dr. John MacArthur  President | The Master's Seminary and College   The Great Commission is not just about sending missionaries, but about sending God's truth through missionaries. This is only possible if we hold unswervingly to biblical inerrancy and the sufficiency of Scripture. TMAI does just that.

No thoughtful answer fails to stretch our language, our categories or our aspirations.   In recent years numerous books have been written on Jesus, books that are shaped by faith or skepticism or follow the Western academic quest for the historical Jesus. The result has been a kaleidoscope of Jesuses, a thicket of viewpoints, some troubling to faith, some puzzling to the intellect, and a few that enrich our vision as they explore familiar terrain from new and promising angles.  Here is a book written by one who for a lifetime has followed Christ with heart, mind, soul and strength. John Stott offers us a vision of Christ whose portrait is discerned in the mosaic pattern of Scripture, whose influence is traced in the great currents of history, and whose compelling call has shaped the story line of ordinary humans who have been charged with extraordinary faith and courage.   The minimalist criteria for weighing the authenticity of Jesus' sayings and deeds yield only a thin outline of Jesus, the barely discernible image of a Jewish sage or prophet. But the criteria of Scripture's testimony and the effective power of Jesus in lives and history point to a multidimensional, incomparable Christ who defies measurement. Jesus is the one figure who, like no other, has changed lives, shaped culture and offers one sure hope for the future. He is the center of history, the focus of Scripture, the heart of mission.

He dissects Paul&#039;s argument to highlight the picture of God and his righteousness painted in Romans 9.

But what if he is born in a cave, is surrounded by animals and his first visitors are unknown shepherds?And what if his birth day presents are obscure and seemingly useless?

In this heart-warming study of the events which culminated in the birth of Jesus, Jim Boice shows us the extraordinary God who loves you and me.

Murray,Biographies,9781848711808,1848711808,"This book is a re-cast, condensed and, in parts, re-written version of the author&#039;s two volumes D. Martyn Lloyd- Jones: The First Forty Years (I982) and The Fight of Faith (I990). Since those dates, the life of Dr Lloyd-Jones has been the subject of comment and assessment in many publications and these have been taken into account. The main purpose of this further biography, however, is to put Dr Lloyd-Jones&#039; life before another generation in more accessible form. The big story is all here.When Lloyd-Jones left medicine, he intended only to be an evangelist in a mission hall in South Wales. No one was more surprised than he in being called to a ministry which would eventually affect churches across the world. How this happened is here explained, but the theme is the person described by F. F. Bruce: &#039;a thoroughly humble man. He was a man of prayer, a powerful evangelist, an expository preacher of rare quality, in the fullest sense a servant of the Word of God.&#039; Behind that theme a greater one emerges. In ML- J&#039;s own words: &#039;My whole life experiences are proof of the sovereignty of God and his direct interference in the lives of men. I cannot help believing what I believe. I would be a madman to believe anything else-the guiding hand of God! It is an astonishment to me. &#039;",Banner of Truth,2013-02-01,2023-06-17,496

The long journey to possession of the Promised Land was prepared by God, yet it led through a path of adversity. We, the readers of the Old Testament, are left to wonder why.  In this engaging commentary on Exodus, J. Alec Motyer explores the character of God through his covenant promises and persistent faithfulness to the people of Israel. Through the story of Israel we are exposed to an unquenchable fire: God the Savior, the Companion and the Indweller, who will not fail those who so often fail him.",Inter-Varsity Press,2005-01-21,2023-06-17,336

How could Christians in the midst of a pagan culture live lives truly pleasing to God? &#039;Only one way--&#039; ansered Paul, &#039;through Jesus Christ.&#039; His answer holds true for us as well.

Named for its two &quot;numberings,&quot; or censuses, of Israel--the generation that left Egypt and the generation that entered the land of promise--Numbers frames a fascinating account of the pilgrim people Israel learning to trust God.  Readers are frequently puzzled by the dazzling variety of literature that makes up this book and wonder how to make sense of the whole. But in this thorough exposition of Numbers, Raymond Brown discloses the careful design and message of Numbers. He shows how God provides for the basic needs of the ideal life: to be loved, to be free, to be certain. Further, Brown highlights the rich theological themes of Numbers, untangles its meaning for today&#039;s readers and shows its enduring relevance for God&#039;s people.",Inter-Varsity Press,2002-02-01,2023-06-17,288

When Paul first penned his letter to the house churches of Rome, his purpose was to gain prayerful support for his coming mission to the western reaches of the Mediterranean world. Little did he know that for two millennia this tautly tuned exposition of the gospel would echo through church and academy, market and home.

This book will help pastors, seminary students, lay leaders and Christians in personal study, to understand how the psalms relate to Christ so they will be better equipped to preach and teach the psalms. Some psalms have a direct relationship to Christ but with other psalms the link is not always as evident. Belcher shows that all the psalms relate in some way to Christ&rsquo;s person or his work. The biblical basis for this view is laid out and then how it works with different types of psalms is examined. In addition to this Belcher then goes on to offer deeper exposition into those psalms that have a direct relationship to Christ. Enlightening, perceptive and balanced, Belcher has successfully filled a void in the study of the Psalms. By doing so he has provided a methodology and a model other can use to understand the psalms in their Old Testament context and how they relate to Christ and to God&rsquo;s people today.",Mentor,2006-12-08,2023-06-17,288

Questions of ministry and liturgy, authority and freedom, appear in a wide variety of guises throughout the world-wide church. Relativism and uncertainty seem to be as common in the church as in the world. Many Christians wonder whether there is any way forward. In this context, The Reformation of the Church is an invaluable aid.

Kilian McDonnell, OSB, called it the best overall treatment of Christian initiation available,&quot; and Paul Bradshaw predicted it would be the standard textbook on the subject for very many years to come.&quot; The current edition draws on new translations of early texts on baptism as well as recent scholarship on the early traditions in the East and West. It is sure to replace itself as the new standard reference on the rites of Christian initiation.Maxwell E. Johnson s expanded and revised text provides a more complete view of the history and interpretation of the rites in the Eastern Church, including two chapters that explore the pre-Nicene Eastern and Western traditions in detail. Revisiting the theology of baptism, this edition also provides more nuanced positions on the Eastern and Western traditions. Finally, recent liturgical developments in American Protestant churches, particularly Lutheran, as well as the ongoing development of the RCIA and confirmation practices of Catholics, made it necessary to revisit the place and meaning of these rites in the church today.",Liturgical Press,2007-12-05,2023-06-17,487

How do they acquire the ability to pray, and lead others in prayer? how are they comforted and supported in all the difficulties they meet? And how can the church be led, taught and guided aright, when Christ is not here on earth? According to the great Puritan leader John Owen, the answer to all these questions is the same: by the gracious and powerful work of the Holy Spirit. He it is who convinces, assures, teaches, comforts and equips the church and all its members for all the work they are called to do. In an age when many think Christianity is nothing more than human effort, based on fallible human conclusions, Owen calls the church back to divine certainty and divine resources. The style in which the Puritans wrote can present difficulties for modern readers, but this updated abridgement of by Dr. R.J.K.

Historian Justo Gonzalez brings to life the people, dramatic events, and shaping ideas of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy during this period, keynoting crucial theological developments while providing fresh understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that influenced the formation of the church. In particular, the author notes recurring themes of unrest, rebellion, and reformation. Gonzalez presents an illuminating record of the lives, impelling ideas, and achievements of such prominent figures as Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, and John Calvin&ndash;&ndash;movers and shapers in the emerging Protestant church. His biographical insights, in conjunction with vivid historical accounts, reveal how individual lives mirror and clarify core theological concerns and developments.

As professor of didactic and polemic theology at Princeton University, he wrote extensively in defense of fundamental Christian doctrines. While his writing touched on the full spectrum of theological topics, it was spread over hundreds of periodicals, books, and pamphlets, and a significant portion has never been published in an accessible form. Warfield stands as a dominant figure on the theological landscape, but few have a comprehensive grasp of his theology, largely because of the difficulty of tracing his ideas through numerous sources. Fred G. Zaspel has spent many years studying Warfield&rsquo;s published and unpublished writing, and presents here a concise and coherent systematic theology per B. B. Warfield. For the first time ever, readers can, in one volume, access the content of this great theologian&rsquo;s academic, sermonic, and devotional works.

To counter our modern tendency to minimize or ignore sickness, pastor Brian Croft looks to paradigms of the past and examines historical models of care that honor God, obey the teachings of Scripture, and communicate loving care to those who are struggling with sickness and disease.  Part of the Practical Shepherding series of resources, Visit the Sick provides pastors and ministry leaders with real-world help to do the work of pastoral ministry in a local church. Visit the Sick gives pastors, church leaders, and caregivers the biblical, theological, pastoral, and practical tools they need to navigate through both the spiritual and physical care of the sick and dying.",Zondervan,2014-06-03,2023-06-17,96
500,"Weak Pastor, Strong Christ",Reuben Bredenhof,Pastoral Ministry,9781601788429,1601788428,"The second letter to the Corinthians is a touchstone for pastors seeking advice on effective ministry. It is a revealing window into the tumult of Paul's relationship with this congregation that shows Paul's concern for the spiritual welfare of a local church. Although he loved the Corinthians dearly and labored for them intensely, their relationship was marked by the tensions and challenges that are acutely familiar to church leaders today: unclear expectations, comparison to other pastors, criticisms of ministry style, vocational stresses, disputes over money, and more. Reuben Bredenhof expertly unpacks these complexities and reveals Paul's vision for Christ-shaped gospel ministry--a vision that can help you, too.

Hyde posed to his father when he first encountered Reformed believers. With their unique beliefs and practices, these Christians didn t fit any of the categories in his mind. Not so many years later, Hyde is now Rev. Daniel R. Hyde, a pastor of a Reformed church. Recognizing that many are on the outside looking in, just as he once was, he wrote Welcome to a Reformed Church: A Guide for Pilgrims to explain what Reformed churches believe and why they structure their life and worship as they do. In layman s terms, Rev. Hyde sketches the historical roots of the Reformed churches, their scriptural and confessional basis, their key beliefs, and the ways in which those beliefs are put into practice. The result is a roadmap for those encountering the Reformed world for the first time and a primer for those who want to know more about their Reformed heritage.",Reformation Trust Publishing,2010-03-17,2023-06-17,178

Can intelligent, educated people really believe what the Bible says? Or do the atheists have it right&mdash;has Christianity been disproven by science and discredited as a guide to morality? Best-selling author Dinesh D&#039;Souza (The Enemy at Home; What&#039;s So Great about America) responds head-on to the anti-God arguments of prominent atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens and defeats them on their own terms. What&#039;s So Great about Christianity provides believers with a straightforward tool kit for meeting the challenge of modern atheism and secularism; for nonbelievers, it offers a compelling apologetic that will challenge their assumptions and affirm that there really is something great about Christianity.","Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",2008-11-04,2023-06-17,368

Even the most faithful, focused Christians can encounter periods of depression and spiritual darkness when joy seems to stay just out of reach. It can happen because of sin, satanic assault, distressing circumstances, or hereditary and other physical causes. In &#039;When the Darkness Will Not Lift&#039;, John Piper aims to give some comfort and guidance to those experiencing spiritual darkness.

Readers will gain insight into the physical side of depression and spiritual darkness, what it means to wait on the Lord in a time of darkness, how unconfessed sin can clog our joy, and how to minister to others who are living without light. Piper uses real-life examples and sensitive narrative to show readers abundant reason to hope that God will pull them out of the pit of despair and into the light once again.",Crossway Books,,2023-06-17,80

Phillips,Commentaries,9781596380288,1596380284,"The book of Zechariah records the prophetic message of Zechariah to the community that had returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile and was charged with rebuilding the temple and city. But the physical return was meant to prompt a spiritual and theological return to faith in the Lord. Zechariah called the people to such a true return and reassured them of the Lord&#039;s willingness to receive them and restore to them the promised blessings. It is a book with an eschatological perspective of special value to Christians today who labor for reformation and long for revival. As are all of the books in the Reformed Expository Commentary series, this exposition of Zechariah is accessible to both pastors and lay readers.
